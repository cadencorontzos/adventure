A text based adventure game using python

This is a text based adventure game given as the final assignment for CSCI 121 at Reed College. (Fall 2019).
The text files were all given as well as some starter code, and the goal was to write code which read the text files and made them into a playable game.

This was a team project done by myself and a classmate.

The goal of the game is to go on the adventure, collecting objects, and eventually completing some goal. The text files can be manipulated to emulate the adventure of the users choosing.
